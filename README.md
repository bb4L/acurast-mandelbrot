# acurast-mandelbrot

This is a proof of concept of having a github page grabbing data from [acurast](https://acurast.com) processors or at least workers using the same sort of websocket connection.

It consists of two subprojects, the `app` having the vue app and the `processor` having the script for the processor.

The github page can be found [here](https://bb4l.github.io/acurast-mandelbrot/index.html)
