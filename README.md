# acurast-mandelbrot

This is a proof of concept of having a github page grabbing data from [acurast](https://acurast.com) processors.

It consists of two subprojects, the `app` having the vue app and the `processor` having the script for the processor.

(and a third `dev` which helped while developping)

There is a folder `sharedUtils` to keep comon logic in one place.

The github page can be found [here](https://bb4l.github.io/acurast-mandelbrot/index.html)

## Disclaimer

- this is just proof of concept
- the js code for sure can be done better, feel free to do a MR
